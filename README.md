# Simon Ma - In Brief

Quantitative linguist. Wok hei enthusiast who dreams of a air-conditioned backyard badminton court. My kitchen smells like burnt garlic and ambition. When not failing at stir-fry, I'm blasting ADO while strumming guitar. Still looking for my wallet dropped in Toronto.

Current mission: Finding a wok that doesn't get destroyed by me
